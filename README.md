 # FELIX

I am an avid learner and spend my time crafting new projects that I am passionate about. My favorite part about creating is that it is limitless, and when I don't know how to do something, I learn it by searching or asking. There is power in the words "I don't know."

# My recent work

I started all of these projects because of one thing: There was something to learn.

## NextTram

A tool for helping me catch the tram on time! It uses Västtrafiks API to get departure data from my nearest tram stop. It is always active on my old phone that I have put in my kitchen. It uses SvelteKit with Tailwind for the CSS, it is just a frontend since it just fetches Västtrafiks API. It is just one static page, but it gets the job done, you know, YAGNI!

## CoRent

This is a tool for calculating the fair amount of rent one should pay in a collective. you can add, remove, and edit tenants. It also uses SvelteKit and Tailwind, but this one has a backend and database. For the backend it uses ExpressJS, and for the database it uses PostgreSQL. It is still a work in progress, my next task is adding Oauth and making the frontend look nice, right now it is just a placeholder page.

## ARK

ARK is a concept website for a board game association, it is therefore mostly for show. I used React and tailwind for the project and it doesn't have a backend, instead it stores dummy data in JSON files in the frontend. There are a lot of improvements to be made to the design, but at least I learned how to take feedback in a constructive way with this project.
