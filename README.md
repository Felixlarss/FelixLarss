 # FELIX

I am an avid learner and spend my time crafting new project that I am passionate about. My favorite part about creating is that it is limitless, and when I don't know how to do something, I learn it by searching or asking. There is power in the words *"I don't know"*.

# My recent work
I have started all of these project because of one thing, there was something to lean

## NextTram

A tool for helping me catch the tram on time! It uses Västtrafiks API to get departure data from my nearest tram stop. It is always active on my old phone that I have put in my kichen.
It uses SvelteKit with tailwind for the css, it is just a frontend sice it just fetches Västtrafiks API. It is just one static page but it gets the job done, you know, YAGNI!


## CoRent

This is a tool for calculating the fair amount of rent one should pay in a kollective, you can add, remove and edit tennnts. In the picture I have cencored the names. It also uses SvelteKit and tailwind but this one has a backend and database. For the backend it uses ExpressJS and for the database it uses Postgresql.
